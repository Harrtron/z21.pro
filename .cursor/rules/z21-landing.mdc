# z21 landing page rule

Build and maintain this page as a single-screen signal, not a marketing site.

## Stack

- Use plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only.
- Avoid frameworks, build tools, and unnecessary dependencies.
- Keep implementation deployable as static files on GitHub Pages.

## Visual direction

- Keep the scene dark-first with near-black background (`#0B0D12`).
- Keep the primary mark bold, centered, and dominant.
- Use chromatic aberration accents with cyan (`#00A0FF`) and pink (`#FF2070`) subtly.
- Keep motion controlled: ambient background shifts, no chaotic animation.

## Content constraints

- Include only the core mark, a short subheading, and optional micro-detail.
- Do not add navigation, footer links, buttons, forms, social icons, or long marketing copy.
- Prioritize mystery and intent over explanation.

## Typography

- Prefer a modern grotesk style with strong headline weight and tight tracking.
- Keep subheading light and slightly letter-spaced.
- Avoid decorative or novelty fonts.
